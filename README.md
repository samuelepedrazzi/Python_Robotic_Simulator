# Assignment #1 for Research Track 1
## Introduction
The main target for the requested commission was to manage the movement and other actions of a robot into a simulation software environment.
The demanded tasks were:
* `The movement of the robot`: it should drive in the counter-clockwise direction around a circuit, which depends on the "Arena" that was already given; 
* `Keeping the robot away from the walls`: it must avoid touching the golden boxes, which delimit the perimeter of the circuit;
* `The management of silver boxes`: when the robot is close to a silver box, it should grab it and move it behind itself.

## Environmental elements
For a visible recognization of the robot in the simulator it's used an holonomic robot icon:

Silver tokens are the ones that should be grabbed for the aim of the project:

Golden tokens are those that should be avoided and they are represented below:
