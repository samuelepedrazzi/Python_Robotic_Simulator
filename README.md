# Assignment #1 for Research Track 1
## Python Robotics Simulator
## Introduction and aim of the project
The main target for the requested commission was to manage the movement and other actions of a robot into a simulation software environment.
The demanded tasks were:
* `The movement of the robot`: it should drive in the counter-clockwise direction around a circuit, which depends on the "Arena" that was already given; 
* `Keeping the robot away from the walls`: it must avoid touching the golden boxes, which delimit the perimeter of the circuit;
* `The management of silver boxes`: when the robot is close to a silver box, it should grab it and move it behind itself.

## Environmental elements
For a visible recognization of the robot in the simulator it's used an holonomic robot icon:

Silver tokens are the ones that should be grabbed for the aim of the project:

Golden tokens are those that should be avoided and they are represented below:

### Installing ###

The requirements for the assignment are: a Python 2.7 installation, the [pygame](http://pygame.org/) library, [PyPyBox2D](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypybox2d/2.1-r331), and [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/).

By using `pip`, it should be installed the pygame dependence by the command: 
```bash
$ pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame
``` 
Otherwise it can be used the operating system's package manager. `PyYAML` and `PyPyBox2D` can be clearly obtained by `pip install PyYAML` and `pip install PyPyBox2D` or it's just fine from `pip` or `easy_install`.

Once the dependencies are installed, simply run the `test.py` script to test out the simulator.

### Running ###

In order to run the assignment in the simulator, simply use `run.py`, passing it the file name, in the specific case, `assignment1.py`, as seen below:

```bash
$ python run.py assignment1.py
```

Robot API
---------

The API for controlling a simulated robot is designed to be as similar as possible to the [SR API][sr-api].

### Motors ###

The simulated robot has two motors configured for skid steering, connected to a two-output [Motor Board](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/motor_board). The left motor is connected to output `0` and the right motor to output `1`.

The Motor Board API is identical to [that of the SR API](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/sr/motors/), except that motor boards cannot be addressed by serial number. So, to turn on the motors, one might write the following:

```python
R.motors[0].m0.power = 25
R.motors[0].m1.power = -25
```

The previous code is used to implement the function to make the holonomic robot turn, `turn(speed, seconds)`; contrariwise both the motors are set to a certain `speed` to make the robot drive in a straight direction.

### The Grabber ###

The robot is equipped with a grabber, capable of picking up a token which is in front of the robot and within 0.4 metres of the robot's centre. To pick up a token, call the `R.grab` method:

```python
success = R.grab()
```

The `R.grab` function returns `True` if a token was successfully picked up, or `False` otherwise. If the robot is already holding a token, it will throw an `AlreadyHoldingSomethingException`.

To drop the token, call the `R.release` method.

In order to use this capacity of the robot, an implemented function deals with the grabbing management: `grab_silver_token(dist, rot_y)`.

Formerly it checks if the robot is at a distance where it can pick up the token (the thrashold is set to 0.4), then verifies if the method R.grab returns, so that it has grabbed the token and it manages to turn around and release the token, otherwise the robot approaches to it.

```python
if R.grab(): 
           print("Gotcha!")
           turn(vTurning, 2)
           R.release()
           drive(-20,1)
           turn(-vTurning, 2)
else:
           print("I'm not close enough.")
           drive(10,0.5)
```

Another condition to be verified is that the robot has to be aligned to the token which it wants to reach.

```python
    elif -a_th<= rot_y <= a_th: 
        print("Ah, that'll do.")
        drive(50, 0.1)
```

Here the robot trajectory corresponds to the one of the detected silver token, at the expense of an angle of 4 degrees. 
Otherwise it should adjust the corner of vision in front of itself to the token. Below it can be seen the control of the correct trajectory: 

```python
    elif rot_y < -a_th: 
        print("Left a bit...")
        turn(-2, 0.5)
    elif rot_y > a_th:
        print("Right a bit...")
        turn(+2, 0.5)
```
   
### Vision ###

To help the robot find tokens and navigate, each token has markers stuck to it, as does each wall. The `R.see` method returns a list of all the markers the robot can see, as `Marker` objects. The robot can only see markers which it is facing towards.

Each `Marker` object has many attributes, such as:

* `info`: a `MarkerInfo` object describing the marker itself. The program uses:
  * `code`: the numeric code of the marker.
  * `marker_type`: the type of object the marker is attached to (either `MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD`, `MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER` or `MARKER_ARENA`).
* `centre`: the location of the marker in polar coordinates, as a `PolarCoord` object. Has the following attributes:
  * `length`: the distance from the centre of the robot to the object (in metres).
  * `rot_y`: rotation about the Y axis in degrees.
* `dist`: an alias for `centre.length`
* `rot_y`: an alias for `centre.rot_y`

The most used ones for the assignment (in my case) are "marker_type" for the research of tokens and "dist" and "rot_y" to manage the correct movement of the robot and the avoidance of collisions.

-------------------------------the detection of silver tokens.
To solve the first problem is used the "find_golden_token()" function which garantees a vision of 60Â° of the area in front of the robot, so that it can pinpoint exactly golden tokens. Thanks to some checks in the "main()" function, the robot is able to keep itself away from the walls and not collide with them.


### Movement around the arena ###

The aim of the robot, as already said, is to move around the circuit clockwise, grabbing silver tokens if there are some alog the path.
In this paragraph let's analize only the part regard to the movement.
The two main problems to make the robot move safely are to face up to the collision avoidance from golden tokens, which represent the wall or the perimeter of the circuit,
